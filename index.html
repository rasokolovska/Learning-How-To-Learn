      <p>Whether it's at school or university,
                the one thing no one ever teaches you 
                is how to teach yourself. We often just 
                end up drilling specific exercises and 
                mindlessly memorizing information so that 
                when exam time comes around, we pass the test. 
                But once the test is over, that information has 
                outlived its usefulness, and there's no guarantee 
                that information will be retained. In the end, 
                we're really just learning how to pass our tests.
      </p>     
      <p><span>Here's the real question:</span>
                s this approach of repetition and
                memorization help us truly understand
                the subject material? The academic consensus
                nowadays is that it doesn't. In fact, what's
                more important than any individual topic is
                knowing how to study, but for some reason,
                this point s often overlooked.
                So, what can we do to remedy this?
              </p>   
      <p>Well, there are various techniques 
                and exercises that can be applied to 
                the educational process to help make 
                it more efficient and engaging. Keep 
                scrolling to uncover some of the secrets 
                of effective learning.

        <div class="two-columns__main-text">
          <p>Math didn't come naturally to Barbara 
                in childhood. She thought of herself as 
                more of a humanities person, and not a 
                brilliant one at that. With an eye to becoming 
                a linguist, after school she enlisted in the 
                army, who sent her to earn Russian. After several 
                years of service, during which she rose to the 
                rank of Captain, Barbara left the army and decided 
                to study engineering. In was during this time that 
                she developed her learning methodology as she was 
                forced to reprogram her brain for a different kind 
                of learning. It turns out that when something doesn't 
                come naturally to you, having to work hard to gain the 
                knowledge that other people may get at first glance gives 
                you a deeper, more comprehensive understanding of the subject 
                matter.
